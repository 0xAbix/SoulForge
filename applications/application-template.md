### Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to zkBankai, SoulForge, or the relevant ecosystem. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ in 1 month.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g., 2 months) [ ***Maximum duration can not exceed 2 months*** ] 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Average number of team members working full time on the project throughout its duration (e.g., 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g., 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the amount requested.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 1.5
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD [ Brownie points to detail the category of expenses ]

| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense. |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our projects and send test transactions, showing how the new functionality works. |

| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone if any. |
| **0e.** | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant. (Content, language, and medium should reflect your target audience described above.) |
