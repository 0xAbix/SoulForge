title: Accepted Grant Applications
layout: applications

Use this page for an overview of all public grants and their status. Each row links to a project's website, their grant application document and code repository.

:::info
This page provides an overview of accepted SoulForge grant applications and their progress. In cases where the link points to an project, please note that the grant application itself is often an independent project unrelated to other work done by the teams.

Additionally, the page lists terminations that occurred due to a breach of the SoulForge grant program terms. Teams might also decide to stop working on the grant—though not necessarily on the project itself—for various reasons, which is not reflected on this sheet.

Furthermore, there is a clear distinction between an application being accepted and the successful delivery of the respective project. Only teams that have successfully delivered a milestone are permitted to make public announcements.
