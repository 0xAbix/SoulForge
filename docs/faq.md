# Frequently Asked Questions<!-- omit in toc -->

## üß≠ General

### How do I apply?

  Please refer to the ["How to Apply" section](Process/how-to-apply.md) in our documentation.

### How much can I ask for?

  Generally, there is no upper limit to grant amounts. However, the higher the requested amount, the stricter the review.

### What activities/positions do you fund?

  The SoulForge's Grants Program aims to fund software development and research activities that are beneficial for the ecosystem as a whole. As such, we don't usually fund tangential costs such as business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach, and‚Äîfor non-infrastructure projects‚Äîdeployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits. We also expect you to have a good understanding of the technologies you are planning to use, meaning that we don't fund time spent learning of Circom or Plonky.

### Who can apply?

  Projects involved in or planning a token sale are not eligible for a SoulForge grant. Additionally, we do not fund projects that promote gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or any criminal activities 

### Can I get an upfront payment?

  The SoulForge Grants Program does not offer upfront payment. If you absolutely require upfront payment, Please contact the team directly.

### When do I get paid?

  Payments are issued once a milestone has been successfully delivered. Successful delivery requires that you have submitted the milestone as per our delivery guidelines _and_ that the Grants team has reviewed _and officially accepted_ your submission. Payment is made within 14 days after approval.

### Can I reuse someone else‚Äôs open-source code?

  Open source software and the Web3 movement are all about collaboration. As long as you meet the code‚Äôs license, we encourage you to find, modify and contribute to already existing libraries and projects if it is of use for your project. However, we expect you to honour other people‚Äôs work and their right to attribution, and your published code to adhere to the license requirements of the code you are benefiting from. Submitting code as part of a milestone that violates someone else‚Äôs license will result in immediate termination. We will furthermore continue to monitor any repositories you may have submitted as part of a milestone for possible license infringements and reserve the right to terminate the grant if we find you going out of your way to hide external contributions.

### My application was rejected. Do you have any recommendations on where to go from here?

  We usually give reasons why an application was rejected. We always try to be constructive and work with you towards an application that is beneficial to all parties. If we find no common ground, please initiate a conversation with the SoulForge team.

### One of your grantees is using my code without respecting the terms of its license

  Please reach out to us asap.

### Why are other grant applications being accepted faster than mine?

  There are many reasons why your application might take longer than others: some applications are straightforward and simple and address an obvious issue, others require deeper understanding and discussion. If your application is highly technical or specialised, we might have to bring in an external evaluator. Sometimes, this specialised evaluator is busy with another evaluation. And sometimes, the committee is simply unsure or not quite convinced.

## üñäÔ∏è Application Process

### How long does it take from application to decision?

  Quality of the application and desirability for the ecosystem, a grant application could be approved within a week. Usually, there will be a discussion and requests for changes, additions or improvements. If no one in the committee finds the application approval-worthy or you don't react to our comments, it will be closed after two weeks of inactivity.

### What is KYC/KYB and why do I have to provide this data?

  In order to comply with regulations, the SoulForge is required to perform KYC (Know Your Customer) checks on individuals and AML (Anti-money Launder) checks on entities applying for a grant in order to verify their identity. For these checks, we ask you to provide legal information about yourself and/or the team members you are working with to the team (Will find a better way to do it in near future). 

## ü•≥ After Approval

### Something came up and I cannot finish the project in time. Can we postpone or call off the rest of my project?

  The SoulForge reserves the right to terminate an agreement that is behind schedule. However, we are not interested in taking away your grant for any slight hiccup. More often than not, delays are part of the journey and do not constitute a reason for concern. The best way to handle changes in your plans is to get in touch with us. If you would like to prematurely end your work, we can amend your application and remove the milestones you won't be able to complete.

### Can I list the SoulForge as a partner?

  No. Once the grants team has accepted your first milestone, you may display our grants badge in a project-specific context, such as the repository containing the grant project work.

### Can you help me advertise my project?

  The SoulForge does not provide PR services to its grantees. However, We will be announcing the projects on [zk-bankai](https://x.com/zk_bankai) twitter account, along with the project description and progress and milestone completion information time to time.
