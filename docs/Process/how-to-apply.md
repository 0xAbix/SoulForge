:::info

The grants are distributed in milestones, with disbursements occurring upon the completion of 85% of the defined milestones. The grants will be distributed in USDT or USDC and sent to KYC/AML verified wallets, preferably exchange wallets. The funds are strictly to be used for the development and testing of the application and may also be utilized to incentivize open source contributions. The grants must not be used for any DeFi activities.

## How to apply:

   1. Please read our [FAQs](../faq.md), [guidelines](../Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md), to familiarize yourself with the subtleties of grants, applications and the program as a whole.
   2. [Fork](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge) our grants program repository.
   3. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the [application template](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge/blob/master/applications/application-template.md). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulforge/soulforge/master/applications/application-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   4. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   5. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our [Grant guidelines for most popular grant categories](../Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md) and make sure your deliverables present a similar level of detail.
   6. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_â€”the Markdown file you created from the template.
   7. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.
