   Milestones are monitored from the submitted project's GitHub account. Once a milestone is completed, the SoulForge team will have a 30-minute call with the project team to review the milestone. Upon approval, the grant team will be notified, and the milestone grants will be coordinated accordingly (as mentioned in the application).

      The SoulForge team or any member of the team will never reach out to applicants asking for funds or requesting private keys. If you receive such messages, it is a scam. Please be cautious and protect your funds.
