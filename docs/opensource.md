# Building Open-Source Projects

As part of the SoulForge Rewards Program, all projects funded through our grants must be open-sourced. This document provides guidelines and best practices for building and maintaining open-source projects.

## Why Open Source?

Open-source projects encourage transparency, collaboration, and innovation. By making your project open-source, you can:
- Attract contributions from the global developer community.
- Increase the visibility and impact of your project.
- Foster trust and credibility within the ecosystem.
- Enable others to learn from and build upon your work.

## License

All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced. We prefer the following licenses:
- Apache 2.0
- GPLv3
- MIT
- Unlicense

Ensure that your project includes a `LICENSE` file in the root directory. This file should contain the full text of the chosen license.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is essential for users and contributors to understand and use your project. At a minimum, include the following:

- **README.md**: An overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and contact information.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the project, including code style, pull request process, and issue tracking.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: A code of conduct to ensure a welcoming and inclusive community.

Consider adding tutorials or video guides to help new users get started.

## Contribution Guidelines

Encourage community contributions by providing clear and detailed contribution guidelines:

- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks.
- **Pull Requests**: Provide a clear process for submitting pull requests, including branch naming conventions, review process, and merge criteria.
- **Code Reviews**: Encourage constructive code reviews and feedback to maintain code quality and foster learning.

## Continuous Integration and Testing

Implement continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests and checks on each pull request. Popular CI services include GitHub Actions, Travis CI, and CircleCI. Ensure that your project has a robust test suite to maintain code quality and reliability.

## Security Best Practices

- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- Follow security best practices for coding, such as input validation and proper error handling.
- If your project handles sensitive data, ensure that it complies with relevant privacy regulations and standards.

## Community Engagement

Build and nurture a community around your project:

- **Communication Channels**: Set up communication channels such as a mailing list, Discord/Slack community, or GitHub Discussions.
- **Community Guidelines**: Establish and enforce community guidelines to maintain a positive and inclusive environment.
- **Events and Meetups**: Organize or participate in events and meetups to promote your project and connect with users and contributors.
