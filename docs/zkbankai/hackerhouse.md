## [***ZK-Bankai Hacker House ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³***](https://www.notion.so/zk-Bankai-Hacker-House-3ac86bddffc348889e425995fc131ae2?pvs=21)

*ZK-Bankai was a hacker house for serious hand-picked zk Builders from the Indian builder community. The house was hosted from* **December 1 - December 7 2023** *in the coolest Web3 hub in **Bangalore, Karnataka**. [Zo World](https://zo.xyz/) hosts core Web3 builders, developers and founders in its space.* 

*The idea was simple, get the best people in the zk space and put them under one roof, see what comes out of it? **zk bankai is a community of 35 people currently, and we invited about 30 hackers IRL for the Hacker house.** 

*To showcase some of the coolest zk projects that can be built, we organised a hacker house event. At the end of the event, we selected the best zk project and awarded a prize. Throughout the hacker house, we had various speakers who shared their extensive knowledge on zk technology. Some of the prominent speakers include:*

- **Sandeep Nailwal** (co-founder of Polygon)
- **Danilo Kim** (co-founder of Kakarot zkEVM)
- **Toghrul Maharrama** (Scroll)
- **Anish Mohammed** (co-founder of Panther protocol)
- **Lucas** (Starkware)
- **Immanuel Segol** (Ingonyama)
- **Bobbin Threadbare** (co-founder of Polygon miden)
- **Jordi Baylina** (co-founder of polygonzkEVM) and many more.

*This was a sponsored hacker house which was sponsored by various protocols like **Polygon, Scroll, Starkware, Kakarot, Panther, and Ingonyama.***
