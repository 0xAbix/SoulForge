When applying for grants under the SoulForge Rewards Program, applicants should be aware that their submissions will be evaluated based on a comprehensive set of guidelines and criteria. The projects are aligned with the program's objectives and can effectively contribute to the ZK ecosystem.

- ### Proposal Guidelines:

The SoulForge Rewards Program is open to anyone interested in applying for a grant. We welcome a broad range of projects, but our primary focus is on strong technical projects that add value to the ZK ecosystem, especially projects utilizing plonky2, plonky3, and circom.

1. Well-defined proposal: The proposal should be submitted with a well-defined problem statement, clearly outlining the issue at hand. It should also include a detailed solution, demonstrating that the problem can be effectively addressed. The proposal must consist of a thoroughly documented expected solution, including milestones and the budget required to implement it. Additionally, it should provide details about the team members, highlighting their backgrounds and relevant experience in the space.

2. Submission Process: A public GitHub repository will be created in ZK-bankai, participants are required to fork the repository and create their proposal in the project application folder with the project name in a markdown file. Create a PR so that committee members can comment on the PR if there are any further questions. Lastly, approved proposals will be merged into the repository.

- ### Evaluation Criteria 
	When evaluating grant applications, the Head Committee and relevant subcommittees focus on several key criteria to ensure alignment with the program's goals and the enhancement of the Polygon ecosystem. 
Innovativeness and feasibility are paramount; the committee seeks projects that present novel, creative approaches and demonstrate a clear, realistic plan with achievable milestones. 
The potential impact on the Polygon ecosystem is crucial, with a preference for projects that can positively affect the community

	Technical merit is rigorously assessed, ensuring that the project's approach is well-founded, logical, and based on sound principles, with high-quality code and documentation following best practices. 
Finally, alignment with Polygon's strategic objectives is essential. Projects that support the overall vision and goals of the ecosystem, fostering innovation and driving the growth and adoption of Polygon technologies.	


## üí∞ Budget Allocation and Financial Planning 

Polygon has allocated USD 100,000 as a reward program focused on the growth of the ZK ecosystem especially to cater to innovation built on plonky2, plonky3, and circom. It is essential to allocate a budget strategically to support the initial growth of the projects. We would also need a small portion of the budget for Administration and community management. This will ensure smooth operation.

We can manage a budget of $10K for community and administration purposes, while the majority of $90k can be used for the distribution of rewards. 
We must have a clear set of instructions on financial planning for the rewards distribution to the selected participants. Implementing robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms is crucial to maintain accountability and ensure that funds are used effectively to achieve the program's objectives. 
We can distribute the rewards in Milestones, based on the milestone completion the allocated money will be distributed to the team. While the team is highly accountable for allocating the budget to solve the problem statement. For the team to be more accountable and transparent, we can ask them to provide a detailed explanation of their budget allocation. 

 
## üë• External Facilitators 

- ### Partnerships and Collaboration
  Collaborate with organizations and members who are actively contributing to the zk ecosystem. These partnerships bring valuable expertise, resources, and networks that can enhance SoulForge's reach and effectiveness. By leveraging their established credibility and connections within the ZK ecosystem communities. These partnerships should not only bring credible teams but also create better credentials for the ZK-bankai community.
